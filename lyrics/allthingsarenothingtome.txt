The state calls it's own violence law, but that of the individual, crime

I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing

All things are nothing to me

The state calls it's own violence law, but that of the individual, crime

All things are nothing to me

You bend your willpower, and you dare to call yourselves free

You have become accustomed to slavery

Down with dogmatism

Down with law

What is not supposed to be my concern?

First and foremost, the Good Cause, then God's cause, the cause of mankind, of truth, of freedom, of humanity, of justice

Further, the cause of my people, my prince, my fatherland; finally, even the cause of Mind, and a thousand other causes

Only my cause is never to be my concern

Shame on the egoist who thinks only of himself!


The divine is God's concern

the human, man's

My concern is neither the divine nor the human, not the true, good, just, free, but solely what is mine, and it is not a general one, but is unique, as I am unique

Nothing is more to me than myself!

All things are nothing to me
